// Two grok-specific quirks, both pinned live by agentHookContracts.itest.ts:
//
//  · Casing is split: the FILE keys events in CamelCase ("SessionStart"), the
//    PAYLOAD reports them in snake_case ("session_start") on a camelCase
//    envelope (sessionId / workspaceRoot / toolName). Neither spelling is a
//    typo; both are contract.
//  · Grok also scans OTHER vendors' hook files — <project>/.claude/settings
//    .json + settings.local.json — by default. Cate injects its claude bridge
//    into settings.local.json, so a grok session fires the CLAUDE wrapper too,
//    with a grok payload. The bridge drops those posts (see BRIDGE_JS's
//    GROK_HOOK_EVENT guard); without it a grok terminal would be labelled
//    Claude Code and offered claude's resume command.
//
// Project hooks are gated on grok's folder trust: until the user runs
// /hooks-trust, the file is silently inert (no error, no events) — and grok
// resolves a project root only inside a git repo, so a non-repo workspace
// never loads them at all. Both are normal, not failure states.
