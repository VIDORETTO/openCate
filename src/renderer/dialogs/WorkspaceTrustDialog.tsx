// =============================================================================
// WorkspaceTrustDialog — the one question openCate asks before opening a project it
// has never opened before: do you trust it?
//
// There are exactly two answers. "Trust and open" opens the project normally.
// "Don't open" leaves it closed — nothing from the folder is read, no panel is
// restored, no process is started. There is deliberately no third "open it but
// hold parts back" option: a half-restored layout is confusing to the user and
// was a whole subsystem to maintain.
//
// So every exit that isn't the primary button means "don't open": Escape and the
// backdrop decline rather than dismiss, and the decline button holds focus so a
// stray Enter can't grant trust. Trust is remembered per project (in userData,
// never in the project) so this is asked once.
//
// Renders the head of the trust store's queue, so a launch that needs to ask
// about several projects asks about them one at a time.
//
// See GHSA-8769-jp52-985f for what an untrusted project's layout could do.
